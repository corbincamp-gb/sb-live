                                                unmatched work ethos Service members bring to the workforce.
                                                Employers craft SkillBridge programs to meet their specific workforce
                                                needs, matching those needs to the skills and abilities of highly
                                                motivated Service members, all at no cost.</p>
                                             <h4>How is this possible?</h4>
                                             <p>The U.S. Department of Defense continues to pay the service member's salary and
                                                benefits while they participate in SkillBridge. This
                                                opportunity may last up to the final 180 days of service. Military
                                                installation Commanders can make on-base facilities available to
                                                industry partners for use in their SkillBridge programs, or members
                                                may be authorized to train at the industry partner's location off
                                                installation at minimal to no cost.</p>
                                             <h4>Reach Talent Anywhere</h4>
                                             <p>Don't let location limit your access to this talented, skilled, and
                                                dedicated workforce. With SkillBridge, your organization can support
                                                service members on active duty while avoiding some of the logistics
                                                of on-site support. SkillBridge partners across the nation may take
                                                advantage of virtual, online, or distance learning and training
                                                options.</p>
                                             <h4>What's the catch?</h4>
                                             <p>It may seem too good to be true, but there is no catch except the opportunity to catch the best talent entering the civilian labor force each year. This unique opportunity is provided to service members by the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD benefits when service members return to civilian life with meaningful and gainful employment. The DOD wants the best possible outcomes for our members--not just short-term jobs, but careers with good pay and opportunities for advancement just as they had during their military service.</p>

                                                   so, have your organization's certificate or letter from the DOL or
                                                   other state or federal authority ready, and send it when
                                                   requested. It is an advantage if your organization appears in the
