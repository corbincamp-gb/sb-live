                           <p>The DOD SkillBridge program is an opportunity for service members to gain valuable civilian work experience through specific industry training, apprenticeships, or internships during the last 180 days of service. DOD SkillBridge connects transitioning service members with industry partners in real-world job experiences.</p>
                           <p>For service members, DOD SkillBridge provides an invaluable chance to work and learn in civilian career areas. For industry partners, DOD SkillBridge is an opportunity to access and leverage the world's most highly trained and motivated workforce at no cost. Service members participating in DOD SkillBridge programs continue receiving their military compensation and benefits, while industry partners provide the civilian training and work experience.</p>
                           <p>Installation and unit commanders who have members about to transition from active duty, bridge the gap between their service members' end of service and the beginning of their civilian careers with the DOD SkillBridge participation. Commanders ease this military-to-civilian transition period for their members when they permit SkillBridge participation with trusted employers.</p>
                           <p>Service members can be granted up to 180 days of permissive duty to focus solely on training full-time with approved industry partners after their chain of command, field grade commander, provides written authorization and approval. These industry partners offer real-world training and in-demand work experience while having the opportunity to evaluate the service member's suitability for future employment.</p>
